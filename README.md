Course link http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring17/CSCI-GA.2620-001/

We are doing road traffic inference. There are two dataset available.
1. Bridge Dataset: We have 5 segments from bridges including Manhattan Bridge and Brooklyn Bridge
2. MTA Bus Dataset: We extracted M15 bus on two segments http://web.mta.info/developers/MTA-Bus-Time-historical-data.html

We have 3 folders. Details inside the folder
1. BridgeData: It is the main folder. How to extract the BridgeData. Analyse time series and Apply Linear Regression.
2. BridgeDataAnalysis: Python code to analyse the time series. Logistic Regression on the Bridge Data.
3. BusData: How to get MTA dataset, Extract data for M15 using Python. Analyse it, Linear Regression etc in Matlab.
